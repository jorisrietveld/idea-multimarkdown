### Source Updated to 3.0.201.91

The update is more like a replacement of the source than an evolution of
it. The directory structure has changed significantly, and a lot of Java
has been converted to Kotlin.

#### Working with the source

IntelliJ Gradle Plugin development environment. See [Building from sources](BUILD.md)

#### Some internal details, should you care to know

The [pegdown][] [Markdown] parser used by the plugin in its original incarnation was changed to
[flexmark-java] and [pegdown] dependencies have been removed as of version 2.2.0.

[flexmark-java] is a fork of [commonmark-java], with changes:

* source element based AST with detailed break down of each element for syntax highlighting
* complete source position tracking for all elements and their lexical parts
* optimized for efficient parsing with many parser extensions installed
* unified core and extension options API to simplify parser/renderer configuration
* options to tweak core parser rules

In the process of making the needed modifications to the original [commonmark-java] parser,
performance was impacted by about 25-35%. This still makes the new parser **7x-10x** faster than
[intellij-markdown] parser used by [Markdown Support] and **25x-50x** faster than pegdown. As an
added benefit, the new parser does not suffer from pegdown's idiosyncrasies of exponential parse
times or pathological input cases that cause infinite loops in the parser's state machine.

On the coding end, the new parser is a joy to maintain and enhance. The parser architecture,
inherited from [commonmark-java], is easy to debug and test. Markdown element parsers have
little or no interdependencies with other element parsers making it easy to fine tune parser
behaviour on a per element basis and add parser configuration options to emulate other markdown
processors. All this is in contrast to pegdown's one big PEG grammar implementation with
everything potentially inter-dependent.

Background
----------

It all started with a desire to see Markdown files in PhpStorm IDE as they would look on GitHub.
I was already using [nicoulaj/idea-markdown plugin] but found its preview was more like
[Craig's List] than [GitHub]. It did not appear to have been recently updated, so I decided to
fork it and modify its style sheet. How hard could that be?

I found out quickly that there was more to it than meets the eye. Rendering is done by Swing not
a browser, the parser is HTML 3.1, with many features not implemented. Additionally, the Table
extension did not work in `pegdown` version used by the plugin.

I upgraded the plugin to use the latest `pegdown`, `parboiled`. Fixed a few bugs. I was already
in the code so I might as well add a few more features like user editable style sheet, fix a few
more bugs, add updates to preview so that I could split the editor pane and edit in one while
seeing the preview in the other.

Now almost four years later, the plugin is brimming with features to make Markdown editing and
creation a breeze. It was more work than I imagined but more satisfying that I had hoped.

It has been a fun trip down the rabbit hole of IntelliJ IDEA plugin development which started
with a simple desire for a Markdown preview that looked like GitHub's.
