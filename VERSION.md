  modified.
* Fix: Add all inherited Java super classes as dependencies to spec file
  even if they do not define options or have `SPEC_RESOURCE` literal.
  The spec file cached data should still be invalidated when those files
  are changed. They may define options and spec literal later.
* Fix: `ProjectFileMonitor` to invalidate the key before restarting code
  analyzer otherwise the key may not be recomputed and code analyzer
  will re-run with stale data.
* Add: `ProjectFilePredicate.getDependentFile()`, if non-null value is
  returned then it will be passed to `DaemonCodeAnalyzer.restartFile()`
  when `ProjectFileMonitor` invalidates the dependency through the

  wants to restart its containing file code analyzer should return the
  file from this method.

  the effect of restarting code analyzer for the file. Adding an
  instance of this as a dependency of any key will restart code analyzer
  on the file when the dependency is invalidated.

* Add: Goto Rendering profile link to show rendering profile/scope
  dialog
* Add: Code style margin override to rendering profile.

  already has a ref anchor causes ref anchors to be duplicated. Ref
  anchor should be replaced when pasted link has one.
* Fix: pasting selection reference (with anchor) on link address which
  already has a ref anchor causes ref anchors to be duplicated. Ref
  anchor should be replaced when pasted link has one.

  task item icon in structure view to reflect this. Only applies to
  incomplete tasks.

    List Item Priority` is enabled. `Has Incomplete First` will use
    priority of item and max priority of its sub-items and sort in order
    of descending priority.
  * `+`: high priority, bold red icon
  * `*`: normal priority, normal red icon
  * `-`: low priority, normal blank icon
  * empty tasks have normal grey icon regardless of priority
  * complete tasks have normal grey checked icon regardless of priority

  in settings.

  `com.intellij.testFramework.builders.JavaModuleFixtureBuilder#addJdk`
  for test JDK builders
* Add: `Add test spec example` intention
* Add: `Copy Upsource Reference` for copying upsource refs in
  intellij-community sources.
* Fix: Add custom protocol to line marker and `MdUrlFakePsiElement` for
  navigation
  * Add: icon for `jetbrains://` custom protocol
  * Add: icon for `upsource://` custom protocol
  * Add: icon for custom protocols
  * Add: Gutter icon option for custom protocols
* Fix: change markdown live template element shortcuts to start with
  `,,` instead of `.` to remove accidental live template insertion when
  typing text.

  still valid.
* Fix: put heading folding settings to one line
* Fix: put flexmark section folding settings to one line
* Fix: line selection anchors to files not updated when files are edited
  only when saved. Applies to all links to other files. Now on any
  change the links to that file are removed from the cache so they get
  recomputed.
* Fix: optimize link resolver to pre-filter files by name, then by fixed
  prefix before applying the regex for full match test. 2x-4x faster
  link resolution with large number of files.
* Fix: use `linkRef.linkToFile()` in `MdCachedResolvedLinks` instead of
  `urlDecode()` which does not work for `WikiLinkRef`
* Fix: reference search scope failed to pass project to hand-rolled
  effective scope
* Fix: use `resolve()` in `MdLineMarkerProvider` for all except wiki
  links or links to wiki pages.
* Fix: use `resolve()` in `MdAnnotator` for all except wiki links and
  wiki page targets and if not resolved then use loose matching to see
  what can be fixed. Right now `MdAnnotator` is not taking advantage of
  resolved link cache and for large files with tons of links it is very
  slow.
* Add: per file resolved link cache. Amazing speed up for preview and
  all functions which require resolved links.
* Fix: url encoded links do not resolve if they have sub-directories in
  the link address.
* Add: Paste Image option to checker transparency background
* Add: Flexmark Example Option gutter icon option for SPEC_EXAMPLE
* Fix: use singleton list cell renderer for Java line marker spec
  options.
* Fix: use singleton or class for list cell renderers for markdown line
  markers: TOC, spec option, emoji, referencing and file elements
* Fix: spec resource resolving in resources.
* Fix: remove `&nbsp;` use in flexmark spec examples. No longer needed
  for GitHub, since it switched to CommonMark processor.
* Fix: HTML escape quotes in line marker tooltip description in rendered
  spec actual output.
* Fix: flexmark option definitions not showing line markers for
  interfaces defining options with rendering subclasses far down the
  class hierarchy
* Fix: flexmark option definitions are not found if defined in
  interfaces instead of direct supers.
* Fix: annotate flexmark option not defined in all test case classes as
  warning and add navigation quick fix to class(es) missing definition.
* Fix: store file cached data in IDE Key<> for each file instead of a
  `PsiMap` keyed on the file.
* Fix: split `base/` platform/java test cases to `plugin-test-util`
  module.
* Fix: complete flexmark java line marker test code using java test spec
  case.
* Fix: NPE in `FlexmarkPsiImplUtils` on resolution of supers
* Fix: refactor platform spec test case impl to have platform/java
  versions and to have a re-usable base for use in other plugins.
* Fix: add new built-in options to edit example options dialog
* Add: gutter icon configuration with the IDE `Editor > General > Gutter
  Icons`.
* Fix: flexmark example `options` keyword completion to work like normal
  completions and add `()` with caret between `()`
* Add: gutter icon configuration with the IDE `Editor > General > Gutter
  Icons`.
* Fix: `MdLineMarkerProvider` no gutter icon for link address and one
  for anchor. Only anchor icon.
* Fix: fake psi navigation elements to return `null` for
  `getContainingFile()` to disable default IDE navigation and force it
  to use `Navigatable.navigate()` of the element.
  * Fix: `MdUrlFakePsiElement`
  * Fix: `MdLineSelectionFakePsiElement`
* Fix: rebuild for new snapshot build of IDE.
* Fix: update GitHub link resolver tests
* Fix: after format document scroll caret into view.
* Add: option to disable list item smarts if wrap on typing is disabled
  to allow quick disabling of list smart keys without adding extra
  shortcuts or actions.
  * when disabled, disable ENTER list smart key.
  * when disabled, disable backspace list smart key.
* Fix: copy selection reference would add 1 line at the end
* Fix: use `BuilderBase.removeExtensions()` to remove
  `TypographicExtension` from extension list.
* Fix: use `MdUrlFakePsiElement.copyForLineMarkerNavigation()` to create
  fake URL which returns null for containing file so line marker
  navigation uses `navigate()` instead of default implementation.
* Fix: missing partial link refs from copy because of typographic
  extension messing with undefined ref link as if it was text.
* Add: disabled reasons as extra text to menu actions to show why an
  item is disabled.
* Fix: change link to reference modified and committed document before
  creating reference which uses an element from the pre-mod psi file
  causing invalid element access.
* Fix: no line markers for remote links with anchors because the anchor
  is not resolved. If an anchor is not resolved then line marker should
  be to the remote link address.
* Fix: `a` tags in headings do not show up in completions of injected
  markdown if only scoped profile `a` tag parser setting is enabled but
  not project. If project is enabled then scope does not matter. Scope
  should not be ignored for injected fragments.
* Fix: much improved image paste destination directory list
  determination (in decreasing order of priority):
  * last used directory for image paste in current file
  * image directories used for image links in current file, prioritized
    by usage count
  * image directories used for image links in markdown files in the
    parent directory of current file, prioritized by usage count across
    all such files.
  * directories containing image files under the current file's parent
    directory, prioritized by number of images in the directory.
* Add: rudimentary matched profiles and scopes for current file to debug
  which scoped profile is used for a file. The scopes and profile
  assignments are ordered with first match used. Figuring out which one
  is applied to a specific file is otherwise impossible.
* Fix: absolute links to wiki pages do not show change link to relative
  for mapped links. Issue was with link map not code. Needed to map only
  to actual git repo URL not local file directory name based URL. Had
  mapping to markdown3.wiki as per wiki directory name in project
  instead of markdown2.wiki as per git remote URL for the project wiki.
* Fix: message bus wrapper disposed test error.
* Fix: spec files no longer render HTML when option selected. This is
  making all spec test examples fail because the contained text is plain
  text.
* Fix: flexmark example option completions are missing all but built-in
  options, for completions need to use `PsiFile.getOriginalFile()` for
  cached data access since the element is a stand-in, its file is a copy
  of the original and no cache information for it is available.
* Fix: compatibility break in community master branch,
  MessageBusFactory, RestartableLexer
* Add: intention to change HTML entities to text, for example `&lt;` to
  `<`
* Add: intention to change text to HTML entities, reverse of HTML
  entities to text
* Add: Actions to for action test text generation.
* Fix: mixed task and non-task items, toggle prefix adds it to all
  instead of removing only task item prefix or adding to only list
  items. Test is done.
* Fix: wiki links from main repo show as unresolved. All vcs roots in
  SNAPSHOT build of IDE were not seen at initialization.
* Fix: diagnostic/4280, editor is disposed.
* Fix: update `flexmark-java` to reworked rich char impl.
* Fix: update `flexmark-java` to reworked rich char impl.
* Fix: update to fixed reverse-regex
* Fix: update to latest flexmark-java
* Fix: spec examples without options have no line marker to Java test
  case file.
* Fix: spec file link refs contain `&nbsp;` after document format
* Fix: spec file once references show unused, they don't change to used,
  cache invalidation issue. When computing a key, getting another key
  only added dependency if that key was computed, instead of always
  adding dependency to parent transaction.
* Fix: psi set/map to not convert psi file keys to original file. Only
  elements reference `originalElement()`
* Fix: spec example injections replaced any section content with ast
  section of new element
* Fix: cached key version did not check it the key is still valid, so if
  key was not recomputed then dependents would think it is still valid.
* Add: all style and parser options to test options to allow quick test
  creation and minimize reluctance to create test because needed options
  are missing.
* Add: tests for cached referenced map and definition count map.
* Fix: format with wrap text disabled would double the indent of
  continuations every time.
* Fix: paragraph wrapping now working in document format
* Fix: enabled wrap on typing. Caret position tracking is off. Needs
  attention.
* Fix: clean up use of smart data lib where char sequences are not
  involved
* Fix: clean up psi edit adjustment use, eliminate null adjustment and
  always provide file/chars for the instance.
* Fix: localize lex parser state access
* Fix: disable all use of smart data, no table formatting, no wrapping
  until fixed
* Fix: Beta 2019.3 surprises. SmartData library not compatible with
  Kotlin 1.3.60 and needs to be removed.
* Fix: formatter control ignored when child of list item. Was by design.
  removed test for top level element.
* Fix: html comment was improperly parsed to PSI if had leading
  whitespace which CommonMark passes on as is, with leading
  non-indenting whitespace.
* Fix: update flexmark-java 0.59.42, refactored and renamed
  `RichSequence`
* Fix: format would loose custom option params on flex example options
* Fix: wrong offset use in MdInlineCode for offset in parent. Not
  handling multi-line content with prefixed parents.
* Fix: `UrlExtractingTextCollectingVisitor` did not collect typographic
  node text
* Fix: plain text (JSON) was asking about HTML to markdown conversion.
* Fix: HTML paste, if plain text == HTML then disable HTML paste button
* Fix: language injections for fenced code blocks and indented code. Too
  vigorous cleanup in plugin.xml. Removed manipulator in error.
* Fix: inline code injection. Returned wrong range in parent. Did not
  handle blank lines or more than 3 marker chars `` ` `` at beginning of
  a paragraph. Now for the latter, inserts `&nbsp;` before the
  inline-code.
* Fix: `PsiSet` and `PsiMap` to not check equivalency of keys for
  `PsiFile`
* Add: compound spec-example sections, to combine previous lower level
  headings via `splice(" - ")` to allow hierarchical structure view for
  spec files
* Fix: formatter to properly generate spec example section names for
  compound sections
* Fix: example option renaming across all related files: markdown/java
  from spec resource and java classes from class super/sub class
  defining the same option.
* Fix: structure view for spec files to allow hierarchies of sections,
  same as headings
* Fix: make undefined example options resolve to test class for the spec
  file for navigation.
* Fix: annotator for example options
* Fix: flexmark project data cache to have super/subclass and super
  nesting information resolved at data computation time.
  `RenderingTestCase` and first implementor of `SpecExampleProcessor` to
  have level 0, all inheritors add +1.
* Fix: java psi file cache to use project sub/super/level information
  and provide options sorted deeper subclass overrides super classes.
* Fix: resolved literals should have literal name with sorted by class
  hierarchy literal expressions for all classes in the hierarchy which
  define the literal of that name.
* Fix: cached data dependencies rewrite. Now done like the IDE cached
  data management but with transactions and automatic data key
  dependency additions.
* Fix: spec-example spec file name resolution should use class relative
  for non absolute resource paths like the tests themselves.
* Fix: Add proper spec resource string to spec file resolution using
  module and module roots
* Fix: flexmark html settings to provide default sections if no sections
  are defined in persisted state
* Fix: enable in place rename for Java side options.
* Add: add global invalidation lock to use for all dataKey invalidation
  actions
* Add: invalidation nesting for invalidation log indentations
* Fix: `CachedDataSet` was not removing invalidated keys, only
  propagating invalidation to their dependents
* Fix: Cache logging now with low 4 digits of millisecond timestamp and
  thread id to show multi-thread activity.
* Fix: transaction manager locks key/data cache lock for the duration of
  get/compute to prevent access to incomplete results from other threads
* Fix: transaction manager now starts get/compute for initial
  transaction in `readAction`, nested transactions are part of it.
* Fix: all cachedData add/remove/test are synchronized to map instance
  for access only. For computations a lock per dataKey/dataCache is used
  to lock get/compute to ensure consistency from different threads.
* Fix: remove erroneous optimization when registering dependencies which
  caused dependencies to be missed
* Fix: add callback to monitors that all container dependencies were
  removed, as occurs on `CachedDataSet.clearCachedData()`

  their own `SPEC_RESOURCE` definition.
* Fix: rename of options with custom param preserves custom params
* Fix: data key dependency version should have data key as the instance
* Fix: add transactions for getting cached key values, without
  transaction can `getOrNull()`
* Fix: add validation to all cached data and recompute if has invalid
  elements and log error.
* Fix: flexmark options do not resolve all the way to base class, base
  class show as unresolved and java file has no line markers. Bug in
  flexmark option stub creation
* Fix: intentions for heading link text mismatch don't work without link
  resolution.
* Add: re-entrant lock on cached data key computation so only one thread
  can do a computation for a given key is at a time. Other keys can
  proceed in parallel.
* Add: re-entrant lock on monitor `addDependent()` and
  `checkDependent()`
* Fix: VirtualFileMonitor now subscribes to
  `VirtualFileManager.VFS_CHANGES.after` instead of the async listener.
  Invalidation is done in `Application.invokeLater`.
* Fix: Psi Monitor now subscribes to
  `DaemonCodeAnalyzer.DAEMON_EVENT_TOPIC.daemonStarting` and invalidates
  dependencies before highlighting run, which is ideal to force
  recomputation of invalid data used for highlighting.
* Fix: Psi Monitor now subscribes to
  `VirtualFileManager.VFS_CHANGES.after`. Checks if virtual file
  corresponds to `PsiFile` for invalidation, in
  `Application.invokeLater`. asdfasf

* Fix: `DataKey` used for nullable value in `HtmlMimeExtension` causing
  `@NotNull` exception when trying to copy HTML mime content.
* Fix: convert inspection to use file cached element data.

  passing it the data key factory which could and does add other keys as
  it retrieves data to compute its value. This was causing concurrent
  modification exception. Now computing value then adding it.
* Fix: make `MutableDataSet` synchronize all access to `HashMap` to make
  it thread safe for lexing/parsing during indexing.
* Add: `CachedDataSet<>` and `CachedDataKey` to have caching of data in
  `MdFile` and automatic invalidation on cache clear

  `Map<String, ? extends DataHolder>`.
* Fix: flexmark resource location/resolver manager class initialization
  conflict

    would snap back to original item.
  * Fix: typing `>` after list item marker but before `>` would loose
    the list item marker in `1. >`
* Fix: diagnostic settings migrated but not saved in new version
* Add: fixed in next release status for exception reports
* Fix: smart inline to not erroneously detect context when in existing
  style marker chars

* Fix: visit handler now maps registered element factory class to final
  mapped class
* Fix: Heading inspections broken, add remapping of handler class for
  replaced class factories
* Fix: add check for unregistered class factory during visit/format
  handler declaration, now undefined classes will log a warning.

  `project.getService()` calls. These return `null` for the component
  and cause null assertion failures and null pointer failures.
